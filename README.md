# emacs-config

This is my basic Emacs configuration. I typically use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) on my Mac. Since Macs don't come shipped with the most up to date version of Emacs, I typically install it with a [Brew](http://brew.sh) Cask. To open the app rather than on the terminal I simply type the following in the terminal:
```
    emacs -a Emacs example.sh
```
