# emacs-config

This is my basic Emacs configuration. I typically use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) on my mac. Since macs don't come shipped with the most up to date version of Emacs, I typically make an alias pointing to my installed version of Emacs(in this case using brew). The line added to my .zshrc file is seen below:
`alias emacs='open -a /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/emacs/24.5-1/Emacs.app $1'`
